# angular-js-todo-list

This is an example app that links an Angular.js ToDo list to a JSON API.  

The first portion of this app was coded from a tutorial [here](http://medialoot.com/blog/angularjs-for-absolute-beginners/).  And then we took the tutorial one step further so users could post and delete items to a database.

We'll be using Turing's [Birdie API Endpoints](https://turing-birdie.herokuapp.com/) to access a remote database so our todo items will persist beyond Angular's temporary, client-side data storage.

To use this app:
- `git clone` this repo.
- open the `index.html` file in your brower.
